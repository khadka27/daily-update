# This workflow creates a daily journal entry in the "journals" directory
# and commits it to the main branch. It runs every day at 18:15 UTC (00:00 Nepal Time).
# The workflow is triggered by a cron schedule and can also be manually triggered.
# The workflow also runs on push to the main branch to ensure that it is working correctly.
# The workflow uses the latest version of Ubuntu as the runner and checks out the code.
# It configures the Git user with a name and email, creates a new journal entry file
# if it doesn't exist, and adds and commits the new journal file. If no new journal file
# was created, it makes an empty commit. Finally, it pushes the changes to the main branch.
# This workflow is useful for automating daily journal entries and keeping track of progress
# and tasks in a project. It can be customized to include specific tasks or focus areas
# for each day. The workflow is designed to be simple and efficient, allowing for easy
# tracking of daily progress and tasks without manual intervention.
